Dear {$parent_1_Name}{if $parent_2_Name} and {$parent_2_Name}{/if}:

Our records indicate that we have not received an electronic signature consent form for {$childName} from:

{foreach from=$parentNames item=parentName}
  {$parentName}
{/foreach}

The electronic signature consent form will allow you to complete the forms online which will streamline our systems and provide a significant time-savings for you.  We need you to complete the attached form asap and return it to the school via fax 415.239.4833 or drop-off at the front desk.

Please note, that a separate form must be completed for each child.

If you have any questions please email Charlie Meade at cmeade@school.org or call him at 415.239.1475.

If you have already submitted the form, please send an email to frontdesk@school.org to confirm they have received the signed form.

You can download the consent form here: http://school.org/SCH_E-ProgramConsentForm.pdf

Thanks.
